    <h1>Leap year</h1>
    <h2>Fun-facts</h2>
    <div id="text">Our yearly calendar is 365 days long, but the Earth actually take a little longer than that to make it's way around the sun. This means that every year we accumulate about 5 hours and 48 minutes of extra time. </div>
    <br>
    <div id="text">If you add the hours up, it makes for around 24 every four years. That's why we add an extra day (February 29th) - to make up for the extra time. If we didn't add that extra day, our seasons would gradually shift and everyone would get confused.</div>
